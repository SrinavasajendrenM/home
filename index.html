		<p>The Rules of soccer are pretty simple first you and another player 
		flip a coin to see who gets first ball. Then If you win when you first
		touch the ball you must pass the ball backward.After that you would pass
		to your teammates and dribble the ball around all of the enemy team players
		your objective is to try and score in the enemy team net without using your hands.
		If you score then you get one point. You are also not allowed to use your hands in anyway.
		If you use your hands or hurt someone intentionally than you would be kicked 
		out of the game and the other team would be allowed to have a penalty shot.
		This is just a overview of the rules of soccer the <a href=http://www.topendsports.com/sport/soccer/basics.htm>full rules</a>
		are much more complicated.
